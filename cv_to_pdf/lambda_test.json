Professionally, I've built applications across industries like Gaming, AI detection, Human Resources and Fintech. I always strive to implement clean(er) code and SOLID principles. From microcontrollers to cloud apps, I stay curious and continuously refine my skills. Based in Patagonia near Mount Piltriquitrón, I enjoy baking and trekking with my family—Luz, Luca, and baby Francesca.",
